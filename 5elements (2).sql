The human element of a Security Operation Center (SOC) makes it a lot easier to detect malevolent intent or even simple mistakes.</p><p style=\"margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 10px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, Arial, sans-serif;\">During the RSA Conference 2020 underway in San Francisco, representatives from the US Department of State have talked about what constitutes an insider threat and how companies can deal with such issues, including by using various filters during the hiring process.</p><p style=\"margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 10px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, Arial, sans-serif;\">Insider threats can come from mistakes or from bad intentions. Jackie Atiles, of the Insider Threat Program Director at the State Department, explained, via <a href=\"https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities---threats/us-state-dept-shares-insider-tips-to-fight-insider-threats/d/d-id/1337163?_mc=rss_x_drr_edt_aud_dr_x_x-rss-simple\" style=\"color: rgb(75, 182, 245); transition: all 0.3s ease 0s;\">DarkReading</a>, why this is a much more complex problem. \"It is not just a tech problem, it\'s not just a security issue, and it\'s not just a personnel issue.\"</p><p style=\"margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 10px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, Arial, sans-serif;\">The State Department representative presented a simple scenario in which an employee sends an email outside the company or institution. That email might contain proprietary information or an attachment with files that should not leave the premises. When or if the IT department catches it, it\'s already too late.</p><p style=\"margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 10px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, Arial, sans-serif;\">Figuring out if it\'s an exception for that employee or a security issue is a difficult task, but that’s what managers and supervisors are for.</p><p style=\"margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 10px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, Arial, sans-serif;\">\"Managers need to manage; managers need to engage,\" said Atiles. \"Supervisors are the best defense against insider threat behavior.

Most insider threats are a mix of technology, personnel, and security, according to officials from the US Department of State.Companies and institutions usually have to watch for threats coming from the outside, but dangers can lurk inside the infrastructure, and they\'re not always clear. The human element of a Security Operation Center (SOC) makes it a lot easier to detect malevolent intent or even simple mistakes.During the RSA Conference 2020 underway in San Francisco, representatives from the US Department of State have talked about what constitutes an insider threat and how companies can deal with such issues, including by using various filters during the hiring process.Insider threats can come from mistakes or from bad intentions. Jackie Atiles, of the Insider Threat Program Director at the State Department, explained, via DarkReading, why this is a much more complex problem. \"It is not just a tech problem, it\'s not just a security issue, and it\'s not just a personnel issue.\"The State Department representative presented a simple scenario in which an employee sends an email outside the company or institution. That email might contain proprietary information or an attachment with files that should not leave the premises. When or if the IT department catches it, it\'s already too late.Figuring out if it\'s an exception for that employee or a security issue is a difficult task, but that’s what managers and supervisors are for.\"Managers need to manage; managers need to engage,\" said Atiles. \"Supervisors are the best defense against insider threat behavior. There is a difference between an introverted employee who wants to alone sometimes and an isolationist who exclusively keeps to themselves all day.\"Of course, an important step in the insider threat model takes place way before any incident is ever recorded, and, in theory, it should help companies avoid the problem in the first place. Vetting new employees and training existing ones -- covering aspects such as data handling, performances, security awareness -- makes a major difference.The main idea of the State Department presentation is that many steps need to be covered for actual security issues to occur, whether they’re intentional or not.

Doing their jobs in isolation with no connectivity, skids have traditionally relied on paper-based processes and periodic site visits for routine maintenance, leaving them vulnerable to inaccuracies and failures—until a company called Trigg Technologies changed that with the help of Rockwell Automation and Microsoft.By modernizing LACT units with sensors and moving that information to the cloud with Azure, Trigg Technologies has enabled its skids for remote service and maintenance, including the ability to monitor the product being transferred to ensure it is correct and coordinate immediate electronic invoicing.“The ability to automate these transactions across thousands of machines and countless miles is transformational for this industry,” Weber says. “Now all parties involved can have immediate electronic records of transactions, real accountability in these remote locations, immediate awareness for maintenance and diagnostics, and new levels of information about every transaction.”Building smarter gas pumpsHundreds of miles downstream and on street corners around the world is another piece of equipment that most people are familiar with: retail gas pumps. While most people use these for gasoline, today many delivery trucks are fueled by liquid natural gas, and so pumps designed to handle that fuel source are making their way to filling stations worldwide as well.  One major oil company is working with local gas stations to install liquid natural gas fueling lanes, and they’re taking it a step further, partnering with Rockwell Automation to connect and cloud-enable the new pumps.Cloud gateway appliances at each station collect the data and securely send it to a cloud platform provided by Rockwell Automation. Collecting and storing realtime data from hundreds of sensors, variable frequency drives and Rockwell Automation’s control systems allows each of the stakeholders across their supply chain to perform their function more efficiently: “On a basic level, there are reports on the functioning of the equipment, inventory of fuel, consumption rates, and analytics to predict when they’ll need to perform preventive maintenance, replenish supplies, etc.,” Weber says. “This drives significant productivity and cost savings.”Rockwell Automation uses Azure to provide the resulting dashboards as a Web application that can be viewed on PCs, iPhones, Windows Phones or Android devices. According to Weber, this flexible platform allows various entities involved with the operation to access the information and put it to use.As the project moves along, Weber says, the volume of data collected could facilitate predictive analysis to better anticipate imminent failures and maintenance needs. The data can also be used to improve the design of pumping stations and other equipment based on that long-term perspective. To facilitate these innovations, Rockwell Automation is beginning to tap into Azure Machine Learning to understand how the massive amounts of data being collected can create even more value.  “The more data we have, the more we can learn and put together algorithms to predict problems,” Weber says. “It’s about taking information from that control system and using it to make those systems even more efficient and productive.”Though it’s still early, the oil company is already planning to expand the project across Europe and North America, with potentially hundreds of sites coming online in the next several months. For its part, Rockwell Automation is looking across the industry at how to enable hundreds of other vendors to service and maintain their own equipment in much the same way.“With Microsoft Azure and the Internet of Things, we can now enable these multitenant solutions for the first time, where the machine builder can gain insight into its equipment in a new way to maintain it and improve it,” Weber says. “The end user can have a completely different but related set of views, and the two can now collaborate much more effectively. It’s just a level of collaboration and knowledge-sharing that really hasn\\\'t existed in the past.”Just something to think about the next time you’re putting gas in your car for the weekend.Read more on the Rockwell Automation oil and gas solutions page, and learn about Azure IoT technologies for manufacturing.  Create the Internet of Your ThingsCreate Internet of Things is not a futuristic technology; it’s here today.
